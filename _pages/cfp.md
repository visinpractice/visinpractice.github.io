# Call for Visualization Practitioner Speakers

The VisInPractice program at [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org) is an opportunity for visualization practitioners and researchers to meet and share experiences, insights, and ideas in applying visualization and visual analytics to real-world use cases. VisInPractice seeks to acknowledge successful transfers of visualization research into applications as well as current visualization practices occurring in industry. Our primary goal is to supplement the successful program of IEEE VIS with content that is relevant to visualization practitioners.

Are you a visualization practitioner and want to speak about your work to the IEEE VIS community? Or do you know someone who would be a great speaker? We are now [accepting suggestions for speakers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BtJfOuLBpmDHltv_Us7ShkrVETyITjxyTpm-_-k6AqQ/edit?usp=sharing), with a preference for practitioners located in and around Vancouver, Victoria, Seattle, Portland, and the northwestern United States, as well as practitioners who have never (or infrequently) attended the IEEE VIS conference. 

Please nominate visualization practitioners **[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BtJfOuLBpmDHltv_Us7ShkrVETyITjxyTpm-_-k6AqQ/edit?usp=sharing)**.
