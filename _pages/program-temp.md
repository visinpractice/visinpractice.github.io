**SPEAKER**: Mollie Pettit, [Data Visualization Society](https://datavisualizationsociety.com) | [@mollzmp](http://twitter.com/mollzmp)

**DESCRIPTION**: The Data Visualization Society aims to collect and establish best practices, fostering a community that supports members as they grow and develop data visualization skills. As data grows more central to our personal and professional lives, the practice of data visualization becomes ever more important.

**SPEAKER BIO**: Mollie tells stories through the creation of interactive data visualizations. Her data data science background is wielded to find interesting and not-so-obvious insights within the data, prepare the data, and be thoughtful about the visual representation of statistical nuances within the data. She is also passionate about teaching data visualization and d3.js via workshops and corporate trainings.

**SPEAKER**: Amber Thomas, *[The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/)* | [@ProQuesAsker](http://twitter.com/ProQuesAsker)

**DESCRIPTION**: When we talk about topics that are debated in culture, you may immediately think of heated, divisive topics publicly debated during political campaigns. Or perhaps you're thinking more of a low-key dispute between friends over beer. At *[The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/)*, an online editorial for visually-led stories, we focus on adding data to both types of debate. The topics and even "serious-ness" of stories we choose to write about vary widely, and we are often asked why we continue to write about "fun" topics with so many more pressing matters at hand. In this talk, I will discuss how we tell stories, the things we've learned from telling "fun" stories, and why we think the internet is better with both.

**SPEAKER BIO**: Amber is a marine biologist and science communicator by training, but she's taking all of the data analysis, statistics, and mathematical modeling skills she's learned and is now applying them to new problems. She's a full-time “Journalist-Engineer” at [Polygraph](http://polygraph.cool) and *[The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/)*.
