**VisInPractice 2020** will take place **virtually** on Monday, October 26 at the **[VIS 2020 Conference](http://ieeevis.org/)** (October 25 - 30), where it will feature invited talks and panel discussions with visualization practitioners. We will announce streaming and discussion platforms in the weeks leading up to the conference.

VisInPractice provides an opportunity for practitioners and researchers to meet and share experiences, insights, and ideas in applying visualization and visual analytics to real use cases.
