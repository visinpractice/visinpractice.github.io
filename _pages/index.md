The **VisInPractice** associated event at **[IEEE VIS 2021](http://ieeevis.org)** will feature invited talks by visualization practitioners during the week of **October 24-29, 2021**, held virtually.

In the meantime, check out what happened at [VisInPractice 2020](assets/vip2020/index.html).

The **VisInPractice** program is an opportunity for visualization practitioners and researchers to meet and share experiences, insights, and ideas in applying data visualization and visual analytics to real use cases. Our goal is to acknowledge successful transfers of visualization research into applications as well as current visualization practices in industry.

# Suggest Visualization Practitioner Speakers

Are you a visualization practitioner and want to speak about your work to the IEEE VIS community? Or do you know someone who would be a great speaker? We are now [accepting suggestions for speakers](mailto:vip@ieeevis.org), as well as practitioners who have never (or infrequently) attended the IEEE VIS conference.
