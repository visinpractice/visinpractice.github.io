The **VisInPractice event** at **[IEEE VIS 2019](http://ieeevis.org)** will feature invited talks by visualization practitioners on **Monday, October 21nd, 2019** in **Vancouver, BC, Canada** at the Vancouver Convention Centre. 

In the meantime, check out what happened at [VisInPractice 2018 in Berlin](assets/vip2018/index.html).

The **VisInPractice** program is an opportunity for visualization practitioners and researchers to meet and share experiences, insights, and ideas in applying visualization and visual analytics to real use cases. Our goal is to acknowledge successful transfers of visualization research into applications as well as current visualization practices in industry.
