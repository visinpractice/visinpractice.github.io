The **VisInPractice event** at **[IEEE VIS 2019](http://ieeevis.org)** will feature invited talks by visualization practitioners on **Monday, October 21st, 2019** in **Vancouver, BC, Canada** at the Vancouver Convention Centre. 

We will reveal the VisInPractice program in Summer 2019. In the meantime, check out what happened at [VisInPractice 2018 in Berlin](assets/vip2018/index.html).

The **VisInPractice** program is an opportunity for visualization practitioners and researchers to meet and share experiences, insights, and ideas in applying visualization and visual analytics to real use cases. Our goal is to acknowledge successful transfers of visualization research into applications as well as current visualization practices in industry.
