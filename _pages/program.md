# Sunday, October 25 or Monday, October 26, 2020 at IEEE VIS 2020

The VisInPractice program is dedicated to those interested in the **practical aspects of data visualization and visual analytics**. The focus is on how to solve real use cases, in contrast to the academic perspectives used in other [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org) events.

The VisInPractice 2020 program will be announced in late summer 2020. The program structure will be similar to that of **[VisInPractice 2019](assets/vip2019/program.html)**.
