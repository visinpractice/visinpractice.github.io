# Monday, October 26 at IEEE VIS 2020

The VisInPractice 2020 program is dedicated to those interested in the **practical aspects of data visualization and visual analytics**. The focus is on how to solve real use cases, in contrast to the academic perspectives used in other [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org) events. Unlike most other events at IEEE VIS, VisInPractice talks have no associated papers.

**VisInPractice 2020** will take place **virtually** on Monday, October 26 at the **[VIS 2020 Conference](https://virtual.ieeevis.org/index.html)** between 10:00 and 15:30 MDT, where it will feature invited talks and a panel discussion with visualization practitioners. The [VisInPractice program](program.html) will be livestreamed on YouTube, and audience Q&A and discussion will take place on Discord (each session has dedicated channels, see below).

<img src="assets/vip2020/julia-detail.jpeg" width="100%" title="Julia Silge: Data Visualization for Machine Learning Practitioners"  alt="Julia Silge: Data Visualization for Machine Learning Practitioners"/>
**SPEAKER**: [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/) ([@juliasilge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge)), [RStudio PBC](https://rstudio.com/)

**DESCRIPTION**: Visual representations of data inform how machine learning practitioners think, understand, and decide. Before charts are ever used for outward communication about a ML system, they are used by the system designers and operators themselves as a tool to make better modeling choices. Practitioners use visualization, from very familiar statistical graphics to creative and less standard plots, at the points of most important human decisions when other ways to validate those decisions can be difficult. Visualization approaches are used to understand both the data that serves as input for machine learning and the models that practitioners create. In this talk, learn about the process of building a ML model in the real world, how and when practitioners use visualization to make more effective choices, and considerations for ML visualization tooling.

**SPEAKER BIO**: Julia Silge is a data scientist and software engineer at [RStudio PBC](https://rstudio.com/) where she works on open source modeling tools. She is both an international keynote speaker and a real-world practitioner focusing on data analysis and machine learning practice.

<img src="assets/vip2020/steve-detail.jpeg" width="100%" title="Steve Maas: Visualization of Data and Results for the FEBio Finite Element Software"  alt="Steve Maas: Visualization of Data and Results for the FEBio Finite Element Software"/>
**SPEAKER**: [Steve Maas](https://www.sci.utah.edu/people/maas.html), [University of Utah Musculoskeletal Research Labs](http://mrl.sci.utah.edu/)

**DESCRIPTION**: FEBio is a finite element software designed for solving problems in computational biomechanics and biophysics. It can be used to solve problems in nonlinear structural mechanics, chemical reaction-diffusion, fluid mechanics, fluid-solid interactions, heat transfer, and more. In FEBio, the main focus is the implementation of constitutive models and modeling scenarios that are of particular interest to the biomechanics/biophysics research communities. FEBio, which is a command-line solver, is supported by FEBio Studio, which provides a graphical user interface to many of FEBio's features and allows users to setup their models, run FEBio, and visualize their results. FEBio Studio uses OpenGL for rendering and we developed many custom visualization algorithms for displaying FE results, including contour plots, vector plots, tensor plots, streamline plots, particle flow visualizations, and more.

In our most recent release of FEBio, we have greatly expanded the software's ability to represent heterogeneous model parameters, which is becoming an increasingly important aspect of computational modeling in biomechanics. This can be used, for instance, to model spatially varying material parameters, material anisotropy, and inhomogeneous boundary conditions or loads. This has posed challenges on both the FEBio solver side, as well as on the FEBio Studio side. In FEBio, various data structures were implemented that allow a variety of data representations over a finite element mesh: Data can be defined for nodes, elements, edges, or surface facets; Different levels of continuity across element and domain boundaries can be chosen. Various data representations can be converted between different formats (E.g. element data can be projected onto nodes). We are also working on mapping these various data representations between meshes to pave the path for doing adaptive mesh refinement in FEBio. On the FEBio Studio side, we are still working on supporting many of these new FEBio features, and many of the current development efforts revolve around how to best present these capabilities to the user. The challenges are not only related to how to best define spatially varying data from a user's perspective, but also in how to best visualize the data for verification purposes. In addition, spatially varying data often comes from images, so we are also working on integrating support for visualizing images and mapping image data onto the finite element mesh. Finally, since FEBio is a command line solver, communication with FEBio goes through different file formats. We use an xml-based input format, and a custom, binary output format for storing results. These file formats have been updated to support the many new data formats that are supported in FEBio.

**SPEAKER BIO**: Dr. Steve Maas is a research associate at the University of Utah. He has developed, along with Dr. Jeffrey Weiss (University of Utah), and Dr. Gerard Ateshian (Columbia University) the FEBio software, a finite element software package for applications in computational biomechanics and biophysics. He has also developed FEBio’s supporting software packages, including the new FEBio flagship, called FEBio Studio.
