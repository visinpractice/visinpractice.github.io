<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>: When we talk about topics that are debated in culture, you may immediately think of heated, divisive topics publicly debated during political campaigns. Or perhaps you’re thinking more of a low-key dispute between friends over beer. At <a href="https://pudding.cool/">The Pudding</a>, an online editorial for visually-led stories, we focus on adding data to both types of debate. The topics and even “serious-ness” of stories we choose to write about vary widely, and we are often asked why we continue to write about “fun” topics with so many more pressing matters at hand. In this talk, I will discuss how we tell stories, the things we’ve learned from telling “fun” stories, and why we think the internet is better with both.</p>

<p><strong>SPEAKER BIO</strong>: Amber is a Senior Journalist Engineer at the online editorial, <a href="https://pudding.cool/">The Pudding</a>. While she has been creating data-driven stories online since 2017, she is, by training, a marine biologist. After a few years of studying animals that lived beneath the waves and communicating science to anyone that would listen, she career-pivoted and has been working with the fine folks at The Pudding ever since.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>: Building custom visualizations is fun, but a thing they don’t teach at VIS (last I checked) is what it’s like building them for a live, production software environment.  I would give some examples of fun, possibly kooky, visualizations I have developed in my professional life and the hidden support costs that came along for the ride.  I could also talk a bit about how to mitigate those costs, and the pros and cons there.</p>

<p><strong>SPEAKER BIO</strong>: After studying computer graphics at Northwestern University, David worked on multivariate and uncertain data visualization at UNC Chapel Hill.  He then spent the next 8.5 years in Seattle at the Allen Institute for Brain Science, initially as a data visualization software engineer, and finally as a director overseeing several production data pipelines.

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>: For the past four years, I’ve been teaching an undergrad “Data Visualization” course made up almost entirely of students who don’t want to be there. It’s a mix of journalism students forced to take my course to get their degree and humanities students who need to take some type of “quantitative course” and think Data Visualization sounds easier than something like Applied Statistics. On the first day of class, I ask students to raise their hand if they hated math in high school. This past semester, all but one student raised their hand. It’s a tough crowd. Yet by the end of the semester, most of my students are excited about data visualization and eager to find ways to apply their new data skills to their other courses and in the workforce when they graduate. In this talk, I’ll share my advice for how to turn data-visualization skeptics into data-visualization enthusiasts. While most relevant to fellow teachers, this talk should also be useful for anyone who has difficulty getting their colleagues as excited about data visualization as they are.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>: The study of Earth System Sciences (ESS) encompasses multiple interrelated disciplines including climate change, severe weather, atmospheric chemistry and pollution, and even space weather, to name a few. Numerical modeling is paramount to furthering human understanding and predictability of complex ESS phenomena. Continual advances in High Performance Computing enables increasingly accurate models, and consequently more and more numerical data.  Visualization of these vast data sets plays an important role in their understanding, as well as communicating insights with peer scientists, stakeholders, and the general public. This talk will present some of the recent work of the Visualization and Analysis Systems &amp; Technology (VAST) team at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). It will touch on the many ways visualization is employed in support of the NCAR mission, and address some of the unique visualization challenges posed by ESS numerical simulation data, as well as the techniques and tools used to address them.</p>

<p><strong>SPEAKER BIO</strong>: John Clyne manages the Visualization and Analysis Systems Technologies (VAST) section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder Colorado. VAST is involved in numerous activities related to the visualization and analysis of Earth System Science (ESS) data, including: development of open source community software, research, and production visualization services. John is the chief architect of the widely used VAPOR package. His research interests include volume rendering, flow visualization, and strategies for large, time-varying data visualization.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>: Formed less than a year ago, <a href="https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/">The Data Visualization Society</a> has grown from three people around a coffee table, to an official global Non-Profit organization with more than 7,000 members.  Mollie will discuss what spurred the decision to create the society, what’s been accomplished so far, and some of the difficulties along the way. Her talk will include a summary of the annual data visualization survey results and what insights it reveals about the data visualization profession.</p>
